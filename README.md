# 5-day-forecast

This is an app that wil show you a 5-day forecast depending on what city you search for.

To run this project either download the entire repo and open the index.html in your browser or use my deployed link (https://sam-st.github.io/weather-checker/)

Upon loading the page you will notice the default location is Philadelphia. To change the city, use the search functionality on the right hand side.
When you search a city name the new weather conditions and forecast will show for that city and a button will appear under the search bar with that city's name.
The buttons are a search history and will only appear if the city name you entered is existant. If you enter an incorrect name, you will receive an alert that says so.
